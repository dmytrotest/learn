i'd love to stay and talk but this is just too complicated for me
the window glass is broken still you know i told you should not leave
but i am running now and you're holding me back
there is just no way to keep you and me together
so dry your eyes and run 
run your own way

(to find you)
(find you) 

dark clouds are forming now
i see the shape of you and then they all just disappear
he's been doing this for years

i'll be running far to find you 
i'll be running far
to 
find 
you
